# Project Aim

The aim of this project is to deliver a simple  command line application, which I have chosen to make as a game. The game is called 'Hangman' and is based around guessing a word by filling blanks that indicate how many letters the word contains.

The origin of the game is unknown but a variant is mentioned in Alice Gommes' book, released 1894 "Birds, Beasts, and Fishes". This version does not contain the hanged man illustration but presents the score of attempts it took for the player to fill in the blanks.
